      <p style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:0px;">How common is breast cancer ?</p>
    </strong>
    <ul style="margin-top:0px;">
      <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source,
        breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. According to statistics from
        the ACS, approximately 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer are
        expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. Invasive breast cancer is
        cancer that has spread from the ducts or glands to other parts of the breast.
        More than 41,000 women are expected to die from the disease.</li>
      <li>
        Breast cancer can also be diagnosed in men. The ACS also estimates that in
        2019, more than 2,600 men will be diagnosed, and approximately 500 men will
        die from the disease.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>
      <p style="font-size:20px; margin-bottom:0px;">Breast Cancer Overview.</p>
    </strong>
    <ul style="margin-top:0px;">
      <li>Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate
        cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way.</li>
      <li>Breast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms
        in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules are the glands that
        produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to
        the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective
        tissue within your breast.</li>
      <li>The uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthy breast tissue and can
        travel to the lymph nodes under the arms. The lymph nodes are a primary
        pathway that help the cancer cells move to other parts of the body.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Breast Cancer stages.</h3>
    <p style="margin:0px;">
      Breast cancer can be divided into stages based on how large the tumor or
      tumors are and how much it has spread. Cancers that are large and/or have
      invaded nearby tissues or organs are at a higher stage than cancers that are
      small and/or still contained in the breast. In order to stage a breast cancer,
      doctors need to know.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the cancer is invasive or noninvasive.</li>
      <li>How large the tumor is.</li>
      <li>Whether the lymph nodes are involved.</li>
      <li>If the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or organs.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <strong>
      <h3 style="margin: 0px;">Breast cancer has five main stages: stages 0 to 5</h3>
    </strong>
    <ul style="margin:0px;">
      <li>Stage 0 breast cancer:</li>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Stage 0:</strong>DCancer cells in DCIS remain confined to the ducts in the breast
          and have not spread into nearby tissue. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Stage 1 breast cancer</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 1A: </strong>The primary tumor is 2 centimeters wide or less and the lymph
          nodes are not affected.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 1B: </strong>Cancer is found in nearby lymph nodes, and either there is no
          tumor in the breast, or the tumor is smaller than 2 cm.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Stage 2 breast cancer</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 2A:</strong> The tumor is smaller than 2 cm and has spread to 1–3 nearby
          lymph nodes, or it’s between 2 and 5 cm and hasn’t spread to any lymph
          nodes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Stage 2B:</strong> The tumor is between 2 and 5 cm and has spread to 1–3
          axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, or it’s larger than 5 cm and hasn’t spread to
          any lymph nodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Stage 3 breast cancer</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 3A : </strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>The cancer has spread to 4–9 axillary lymph nodes or has enlarged
            the internal mammary lymph nodes, and the primary tumor can be
            any size.</li>
          <li>Tumors are greater than 5 cm and the cancer has spread to 1–3
            axillary lymph nodes or any breastbone nodes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 3B: </strong> A tumor has invaded the chest wall or skin and may or may not
          have invaded up to 9 lymph nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 3C: </strong> Cancer is found in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, lymph
          nodes near the collarbone, or internal mammary nodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Stage 4 breast cancer: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Stage 4 breast cancer can have a tumor of any size, and its cancer cells have
          spread to nearby and distant lymph nodes as well as distant organs.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul><br>
    <h3 style="margin: 0px;">Preemptive treatment</h3>
    <ul style="margin:0px;">
      <li>Some women are at increased risk of breast cancer due to hereditary factors. For
        instance, if your mother or father has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, you’re
        at higher risk of having it as well. This significantly raises your risk of breast
        cancer.</li>
      <li>If you’re at risk for this mutation, talk to your doctor about your diagnostic and
        prophylactic treatment options. You may want to be tested to find out if you
        definitely have the mutation. And if you learn that you do have it, discuss with
        your doctor any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting
        breast cancer.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3 style="margin: 0px;">Breast cancer treatment</h3> </strong>
    <p style="margin:0px;">
      Your breast cancer’s stage, how far it has invaded (if it has), and how big the
      tumor has grown all play a large part in determining what kind of treatment you’ll
      need.
      To start, your doctor will determine your cancer’s size, stage, and grade (how
      likely it is to grow and spread). After that, you can discuss your treatment options.
      Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many women have
      additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or
      hormone therapy.</p>
    <h3>Surgery</h3>
    Several types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including:
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Lumpectomy: </strong> This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding
        tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact.</li>
      <li><strong>Mastectomy: </strong>In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast.In a
        double mastectomy, both breasts are removed.</li>
      <li><strong>Sentinel node biopsy:</strong> This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes
        that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If
        they don’t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove
        more lymph nodes.</li>
      <li><strong>Axillary lymph node dissection: </strong>If lymph nodes removed during a
        sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, your doctor may remove
        additional lymph nodes.</li>
      <li><strong>Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy: </strong>Even though breast cancer may
        be present in only one breast, some women elect to have a contralateral
        prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to
        reduce your risk of developing breast cancer again.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Radiation therapy:</h3>
    With radiation therapy, high-powered beams of radiation are used to target and
    kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This
    technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body.
    Advances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from
    inside the body. This type of radiation treatment is called brachytherapy. To
    conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the
    body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and
    work to destroy cancer cells.
    <br>
    <h3>Chemotherapy:</h3>
    <p style="margin:0px;">Chemotherapy is a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people
      may undergo chemotherapy on its own, but this type of treatment is often used
      along with other treatments, especially surgery.
      <br>
      In some cases, doctors prefer to give patients chemotherapy before surgery. The
      hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not
      need to be as invasive. Chemotherapy has many unwanted side effects, so
      discuss your concerns with your doctor before starting treatment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin:0px;">Hormone therapy:</h3>
    <p style="margin:0px;">
      If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, your doctor may start you
      on hormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can
      stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors. Hormone therapy works by
      blocking your body’s production of these hormones, or by blocking the hormone
      receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the
      growth of your cancer.
